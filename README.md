Tracks Fortnites cloudstorage

The action checks for updates in the cloud storage every 15 minutes and updates all the files that changed.  
The _persistent folder contains a merged version of the hotfixes. The files in the root are applied to all platforms and the files in the platform folder are applied by that platform only.
